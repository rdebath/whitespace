The number of permutations of three characters is 27, we have 24 instructions
so there should be no need for more than three. However, we are tending to
avoid linefeeds and we want to use the 'ss' short code.

ss	N	push		Push

sts	N	N-pick		Ref ***		0 pick == dup, like forth
stl	N	leave		Slide ***

sls		dup		Dup		as forth
slt		swap		Swap		as forth
sll		drop		Discard		as forth

tsss		add		Plus		as forth
tsst		sub		Minus		as forth
tssl		mul		Times		as forth

tsts		div		Divide		as forth
tstt		mod		Modulo		as forth

tts		store		Store		swaped relative to forth
ttt		fetch		Retrieve	as forth

tlss		outc		OutputChar	as forth emit
tlst		outn		OutputNum

tlts		readc		ReadChar	reads into memory like forth "expect" but only one char at a time.
tltt		readn		ReadNum

lss	L	label		Label
lst	L	call		Call
lsl	L	jmp		Jump

lts	L	jz		If-Zero
ltt	L	jn		If-Negative
ltl		ret		Return

lll		quit		End

// *** These two added later -- V0.3
//     "N-pick (Copy/Ref) is just like Forth (excpet it uses a constant);
//     "N-slide" is a limited substitute for ROT.
//     The "N" must be positive so only valid forms are "stls" and "stss"

// some suggestions...
// stts		pick
// sttt		roll
// sttl		depth
// These codes make the language Turing complete without "fetch" and "store".
//
// ssl		(N -- R) 'R' is a random value between 0 and N-1 inclusive
// ssl		(N 0 -- ) Init the pseudo random number generator with N
//                        Zero means an unknown external source which MAY be
//                        just a clock.

// Unused prefixes. (ssl may be a zero)
